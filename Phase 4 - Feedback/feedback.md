## Peer Feedback

_Summary of feedback recieved from Phase 3 video:_

### Conceptual model observations:

* Balance is hidden under ID, not on the main screen.
* Library confusion: "Choose From Library" sounds like a building. Use "Gallery" instead for photos.
* Meal plan selection: All plans have a checkmark; confusing like all are selected to buy.
* Add text to "Pickup" and "Delivery" IDs for clarity.
* Parking and Dining up front is good; "ID" feels like "Account."
* Dining menu issue: No location for food items shown.
* Reflect the option for multiple dining locations.

### Button Appearance Issues:

* **Homepage Buttons**: They don't look clickable. Add drop shadow to show they are buttons.
* **Example ID Display**: Confusing. Is it clickable?

### Color Usage:

:+1: Great color use to show selectable areas. No issues here.

### Meal Plan Selection:

* Checkout button should be heavier than term selection.

### Comments on Icons:

* **Credit Card Icon**: The last name icon as a credit card is confusing.
* **Unclear Person Icon**: Most buttons are clear, but unsure about the person icon's function.

### ID Page Confusion:

* **ID Actions**: "Get New ID" vs "Replace ID" is unclear.
Shipping Info: Where is the ID shipping info? It may not match the billing address.

### Feedback Comments:

* **Unclear Notifications**: Parking ticket alert doesn't disappear after payment.

* **Lack of Feedback**: New Student ID - no response when "Delivery" checkbox is clicked. Finance Actions - no total shown before payment; no success message.

* **Balance Information Missing**: No updated balance after adding funds.

* **Weak Confirmation Signals**: Payments have little feedback. Checkout screen looks like an error page.

* **Screen Transitions**: Smoother transitions between screens are needed.

* **Minor Issues**: No visual change on 'Add Funds' page when selecting $50 option. May be due to time restrictions.

### Overall Feedback: (TL;DR) 

* :point_right: Ensure more effective feedback and visible confirmations for transactions and selections.

### Mapping Comments

* **Button Press Errors**: Home button on bottom left may be confused with back button.

* **Access Balance Easily**: Balance should be accessible from the home screen.

#### Consistent Page Mapping:

* :+1: Pages and sub-pages are consistently mapped, giving a balanced feel.

* Consider more consistency between different pages for better flow.

#### Control Placement:

* :+1: Buttons are at the bottom, back button is at the top. Feels natural.

* :+1: No issues with control positions observed

### Constraints Comments

* :point_right: **Parking Tickets**: Must pay all at once, can't pay one by one.

* **Checkout Continue Button**: Should be inactive until info is entered.

* **Page Visibility**: Important things like ID replacements should be less obvious.

* **Few Extra Needs**: Main concern is the inactive "Continue" button until info is filled.

### Logo Feedback:

* :+1: Like the minimal design. The gold tassel adds a nice touch.

* Font change needed? Current font seems boring.

* :+1: Clear representation of app's services. Useful for those unsure of all the app offers.

* **Practical concerns**: Logo may need updates if app services change.

* :+1: The graduation cap looks nice.
