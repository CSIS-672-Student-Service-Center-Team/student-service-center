## Peer Feedback

_Summary of feedback recieved from Phase 3 video:_

### Conceptual model observations:

* Balance is hidden under ID, not on the main screen.
* Library confusion: "Choose From Library" sounds like a building. Use "Gallery" instead for photos.
* Meal plan selection: All plans have a checkmark; confusing like all are selected to buy.
* Add text to "Pickup" and "Delivery" IDs for clarity.
* Parking and Dining up front is good; "ID" feels like "Account."
* Dining menu issue: No location for food items shown.
* Reflect the option for multiple dining locations.

### Button Appearance Issues:

* **Homepage Buttons**: They don't look clickable. Add drop shadow to show they are buttons.
* **Example ID Display**: Confusing. Is it clickable?

### Color Usage:

:+1: Great color use to show selectable areas. No issues here.

### Meal Plan Selection:

* Checkout button should be heavier than term selection.

### Comments on Icons:

* **Credit Card Icon**: The last name icon as a credit card is confusing.
* **Unclear Person Icon**: Most buttons are clear, but unsure about the person icon's function.

# ID Page Confusion:

* **ID Actions**: "Get New ID" vs "Replace ID" is unclear.
Shipping Info: Where is the ID shipping info? It may not match the billing address.
