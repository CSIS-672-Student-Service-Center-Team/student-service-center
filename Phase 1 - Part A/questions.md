Below is a revised set of interview questions, designed to be more detailed and focused on key aspects of
human-computer interaction (HCI), such as usability, accessibility, user satisfaction, and interaction
design.
1. Student ID Management:

of flexibility would you expect (e.g., changing pass details, scheduling returns)?
b. Error Prevention & Recovery:
i. Have you ever made a mistake or faced an issue (e.g., selecting the wrong
parking pass, forgetting a return) during the parking pass process? How should an
app help prevent these errors or assist in correcting them?
ii. What kind of feedback would you expect if something went wrong during the
process (e.g., invalid inputs, payment issues)? How should the app help you
resolve the issue?
3. Parking Ticket Management:
a. Efficiency & User Satisfaction:
i. What steps do you currently take to pay a parking ticket? How efficient do you
find this process? What are the most significant pain points?
ii. How would you describe the ideal process for paying a parking ticket via an app?
What features or interactions would make you feel satisfied with the experience?
b. Consistency & Standards:
i. How consistent do you find the current user interfaces (online or offline) for
managing parking tickets? What inconsistencies have you noticed that affect your
experience?
ii. How should an app ensure consistency in design and functionality to align with
your expectations?
4. Parking Availability:
a. Information Design & Visualization:
i. How do you currently find parking availability in downtown garages? How well
does the current system communicate the information you need?
ii. In an app, how would you like parking availability information to be presented?
Would a map, list, or some other visualization be most helpful? What level of
detail would you expect?
b. Real-Time Interaction & Feedback:
i. How important is real-time information to you when searching for parking? How
should the app handle real-time updates to ensure the information is accurate and
up-to-date?
ii. What type of feedback or confirmation would you expect after reserving or
selecting a parking spot via the app?
5. Meal Plan Management:
a. Personalization & User Needs:
i. How do you currently choose and manage your meal plan? How well does the
current process meet your personal needs and preferences?
ii. How should an app personalize the meal plan experience for you (e.g.,
recommendations based on eating habits, dietary preferences)?
b. Learnability & User Experience:
i. If you were using an app to manage your meal plan, how quickly would you
expect to learn how to use it effectively? What features or design elements would
contribute to a smooth learning curve?
ii. Can you describe an ideal first-time experience with the app for selecting and
managing a meal plan? What would make you feel confident using the app from
the start?
6. Student Card Balance Management:
a. Feedback & Confirmation:
i. How do you currently check and reload your student card balance? How
confident do you feel after completing a transaction?
ii. What type of immediate feedback or confirmation would you need from an app
after reloading your student card balance to feel secure that the transaction was
successful?
b. Visibility of System Status:
i. When managing your student card balance, how important is it for you to see the
system’s status (e.g., current balance, pending transactions)? What kind of
interface elements would provide this information effectively?
ii. What would be your expectations if the system is temporarily unavailable or
slow? How should the app communicate this to you?
